Roll forming, sometimes spelled rollforming, is a metal forming process in which sheet metal is progressively
shaped through a series of bending operations.The process is performed on a roll forming line in which the 
sheet metal stock is fed through a series of roll stations.@
Each station has a roller, referred to as a roller die, positioned on both sides of the sheet. The shape and
size of the roller die may be unique to that station, or several identical roller dies may be used in different
positions.@
